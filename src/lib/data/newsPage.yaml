      html: <h2>The $4.9B Funding from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</h2><p>In
        November 2021, President Joe Biden signed the <a
        title="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Bipartisan
        Infrastructure Law</a>, a once-in-a-generation investment to tackle the
        climate crisis. The law earmarked about $12 billion to carbon
        management, specifically to carbon capture, storage, and transportation
        of CO2. </p><p>Under this law, the DOE revealed its $4.9 billion funding
        for 3 carbon management demonstration and deployment programs. These
        funding opportunities seek to slash emissions from power generation and
        sectors that are difficult to decarbonize like steel and
        cement. </p><p>According to the Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, the
        series of funding initiatives are crucial in meeting Biden’s goal to
        reach a net zero economy by 2050. </p><p>The Department also launched
        four programs with <a
        title="https://carboncredits.com/us-doe-to-invest-3-7-billion-on-carbon-removal-technologies/"
        href="https://carboncredits.com/us-doe-to-invest-3-7-billion-on-carbon-removal-technologies/">$3.7
        billion funding</a> to help scale up the carbon dioxide removal
        industry. These include the $115 million prize awards to <a
        title="https://carboncredits.com/how-direct-air-capture-works-and-4-important-things-about-it/"
        href="https://carboncredits.com/how-direct-air-capture-works-and-4-important-things-about-it/">Direct
        Air Capture</a> technologies to bolster different approaches to DAC. The
        program also includes building regional DAC hubs in the
        country. </p><h2>DOE’s $2.25B Program for Carbon Capture and
        Storage</h2><p>One of the Department’s new funding opportunities is
        the $2.25 billion for the validation and testing of large-scale,
        commercial carbon storage projects. Qualifying projects should be
        capable of storing 50 million tonnes of CO2 and the Department just
        revealed the winning applicants. </p><ul><li><div>The agency picked 9
        commercial carbon storage projects qualified for federal funding. These
        winning projects are found in the Midwest, West and on the Gulf
        Coast. </div></li></ul><p>The recipients include 4 higher education
        institutions, BP PLC subsidiary BP Corporation North America, and the
        Southern States Energy Board.</p><p>Pointing out that the funding wisely
        focuses on carbon storage projects, an executive from the Carbon Capture
        Coalition stated:</p><p><em>“The US has abundant, well-characterized
        carbon storage capacity that can safely and permanently store billions
        of tons of carbon dioxide emissions, but currently lacks the
        necessary infrastructure and capture facilities to fully utilize this
        potential”.</em></p><p>Indeed, the recent funding announcement will help
        address that infrastructure gap. </p><p>Earlier this year, the <a
        title="https://carboncredits.com/u-s-doe-funds-carbon-capture-programs-with-2-5-billion/"
        href="https://carboncredits.com/u-s-doe-funds-carbon-capture-programs-with-2-5-billion/">DOE
        also rolled out $2.52 billion</a> to fund 2 carbon capture initiatives.
        These are the “Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilots” and “Carbon Capture
        Demonstration Projects Program” seeking to cut emissions from
        hard-to-abate industries. The main goal is to speed up and boost
        investment in technologies that capture, transport and store
        carbon.</p><p>All these funds for carbon capture and removal projects
        are part of the total of $62 billion dedicated by the bipartisan
        infrastructure law for DOE’s research, development, demonstration, and
        deployment of clean energy technologies. </p><h3>Expanding Carbon
        Capture and Storage </h3><p>Complementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure
        Law, the Congress expanded the tax credits for carbon capture in the <a
        title="https://carboncredits.com/us-congress-369-billion-climate-change-bill/"
        href="https://carboncredits.com/us-congress-369-billion-climate-change-bill/">2022
        Inflation Reduction Act</a>. It awards polluters up to $85 for every
        metric ton of carbon captured and stored safely
        underground. </p><ul><li><div>As per DOE’s estimates, actions under the
        two laws will result in 40% emissions reduction against 2005 levels
        economy-wide.</div></li></ul><p>The agency further said that the
        remaining funds for carbon storage are available under a broader scope.
        The funding program now includes early-stage development projects while
        expanding the definition of carbon storage to support more offshore
        projects. Project developers can apply under the program until July
        6. </p><p>The Department also selected 3 carbon transportation projects
        in Texas and Wyoming to receive funding from another program. Together,
        they’ll get a total of $9 million for engineering and design
        activities. </p>

        "<p>The Alaska House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that
        would allow the state to set up a system for using state land to sell
        carbon-offset credits. The House action amounted to final passage of the
        bill, which was approved the previous day by the state Senate.</p><p>The
        measure, Senate Bill 48, authorizes the Alaska Department of Natural
        Resources to lease out state land for up to 55 years for the purpose of
        preserving its powers to absorb atmospheric carbon.</p><p>The bill has
        been a high priority for Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The Republican governor
        responded immediately after the House vote with a brief message on
        Twitter: “Thank you to the House for passing SB 48! We are changing the
        conversation for Alaska concerning new revenue.”</p><p>A follow-up news
        release by the governor’s office said that once the bill is signed into
        law, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources will begin to develop
        regulations for the program, and that there will be a “robust public
        input process” as those rules are created.</p><p>“Today marks an
        exciting new chapter for natural resources in Alaska with the passage of
        Governor Mike Dunleavy’s carbon offset bill,” John Boyle, commissioner
        of the Department of Natural Resources, said in the governor’s release.
        He credited work by his department and by the Alaska Oil and Gas
        Conservation Commission.</p><p>From left to right: Alaska Department of

        the House chambers shortly before House Bill 48, the governor’s carbon
        credits measure, passed the House. (James Brooks / Alaska
        Beacon)</p><p>“I’m grateful our DNR experts and AOGCC partners were able
        to work with the legislature to deliver a bill giving Alaska a new
        revenue stream that complements our current resource development
        industries and Alaskans’ use of State land,” Boyle said. “I’m
        particularly excited about the opportunities to more actively manage and
        invest in our forests.”</p><p>Most of the comments made on the House
        floor leading up to the vote touted the bill’s potential for generating
        state revenue from national and global demand for carbon offsets, which
        are seen as tools to combat climate change. Because of its focus on the
        state’s forested land, the measure has been dubbed the “tree”
        bill.</p><p>But at least one legislator, Rep. Andy Josephson,
        D-Anchorage, described it as good for the Alaska environment, aside from
        its resource-development qualities.</p><p>“In fact, it’s supposed to, it
        must, it’s compelled to have no net loss on biomass. We heard that
        testimony. So this is, in that respect, a conservation bill from an
        Alaskan lens,” he said during a Tuesday afternoon House Finance
        Committee hearing that preceded the floor vote.</p><p>Rep. Andy
        Josephson, D-Anchorage, asks a question about Senate Bill 48, the carbon
        credits bill, on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in the House Finance Committee.
        (James Brooks / Alaska Beacon)</p><p>Unlike the Senate vote on Monday,
        Tuesday’s House vote was not unanimous. There were two votes against the
        bill — from Rep. David Eastman, R-Wasilla, who called it “climate
        communism,” and Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer.</p><p>A separate-but-related
        bill introduced by Dunleavy would establish a system for using old oil
        and gas wells to sequester carbon gases produced through petroleum
        operations and other industrial activities. That proposal, in Senate
        Bill 49 and House Bill 50 and nicknamed the “hole” bill, did not move as
        quickly as the carbon-offsets bill. However, one element of the “hole”
        bill was transferred to Senate Bill 48: a provision authorizing AOGCC to
        gain primary enforcement authority over the injection wells that would
        be used to store the carbon. Currently, the federal Environmental
        Protection Agency has enforcement authority over those wells in
        Alaska.</p>"

        <p>Amid the global energy crisis and economic issues, revenues from carbon
        credits traded in emissions trading systems (ETS) and carbon taxes hit
        record high in 2022 reaching almost $100 billion, per the World Bank
        carbon pricing report. </p><p>Carbon pricing is an essential policy tool
        useful in decarbonizing global economies. Through various instruments,
        carbon prices bring economic incentives to make climate-friendly changes
        in consumption, production, and investment. </p><p>The World Bank’s <a
        title="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/58f2a409-9bb7-4ee6-899d-be47835c838f"
        href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/58f2a409-9bb7-4ee6-899d-be47835c838f">State
        and Trends in Carbon Pricing 2023</a> report provides an updated
        overview of the existing and emerging carbon pricing instruments
        worldwide. It also explores the trends and drivers of those instruments,
        including carbon taxes, carbon crediting mechanisms, and emissions
        trading systems. </p><p>As highlighted in the report, carbon pricing has
        to continue growing, in price and coverage, to drive climate action and
        meet the Paris goals. Here are the six key takeaways from the World Bank
        carbon pricing report. </p><h2>#1. Carbon prices growth slowed but
        showed resilience</h2><p>After years of high growth, carbon prices in
        ETSs and carbon taxes had slowed but showed resilience. They have made
        it through the global energy crisis last year, and even half of the
        instruments’ prices have increased. About a third have the same prices
        while fewer than <strong>15%</strong> decline. </p><p>The European Union
        ETS recorded the largest increases, with price surging 100 Euros for the
        first time. It is linked with the Switzerland ETSs. </p><h4>But in other
        ETS, carbon prices were down by up to 35% like the case of Republic of
        Korea ETS.</h4><p>While some countries or jurisdictions toned down their
        plans to increase carbon prices, many didn’t. In fact, several of them
        decided to strengthen their existing ETSs and carbon taxes in the coming
        years. </p><p>For instance, Singapore made changes in its carbon pricing
        bill that will increase the nation’s carbon tax beginning in 2026, from
        <u>USD 4-34 to USD 38-60</u>. Likewise, Canada is pursuing its plan to
        increase its federal baseline to go over <u>USD 127 by
        2030</u>. </p><p>Apart from policy changes, energy markets and drought
        were some of the biggest factors affecting carbon prices in most ETSs.
        In many European nations, the combined effects were enough to halt the
        declining trend in coal use while higher power sector CO2 emissions
        caused EU ETS to rise. </p><p>Overall, carbon prices have to grow in the
        long term to drive investments at the scale and pace needed. To keep
        global warming below 2°C, prices need to reach <u>$50/tCO2 to $100/tCO2
        by 2030</u>. Factoring in inflation, that price range would be
        at<strong> </strong>$61 to $122 by 2030 in 2023 USD. </p><p>As of April
        2023, under <strong>5%</strong> of global GHG emissions are covered by a
        direct carbon price at or above the range suggested by 2030 (in 2023 US
        dollar value). Most of these high-price carbon pricing instruments are
        found in European countries as seen in the chart below. Blue shades
        refer to ETS prices while the pink ones represent carbon
        taxes. </p><h2>#2. Number of ETSs and carbon taxes implemented slightly
        grew</h2><p>The number of ETS and carbon taxes adopted has gone up
        slightly to <strong>73 as of April 2023</strong>. The increase is mostly
        in countries that are already pricing carbon, referring to the map
        below. </p><p>In 2022, several jurisdictions delivered on their existing
        plans for new ETSs or carbon taxes or increased their ambition. Some of
        them also revealed more proposals to develop new carbon pricing
        initiatives. </p><p>Emerging economies are showing growing interest in
        adopting carbon credit instruments but high-income nations still
        dominate the global market. </p><p>Overall, the little increase in the
        carbon instruments in operation cover about<strong> 23%</strong> of
        global carbon emissions. This rise represents a below
        <strong>1%</strong> increase relative to the previous
        year. </p><p>Carbon pricing mechanisms today are mainly focused on
        energy and industrial emissions. Most carbon taxes cover certain fossil
        fuels used in different sectors, while ETSs often focus on big
        industrial facilities. </p><p>New Zealand will be the first country in
        the world to put a price on agricultural emissions in 2025. This is
        separate from the country’s existing ETS and will be applied at the farm
        level. </p><p>While other countries are also considering the creation of
        future ETS such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand, for instance.
        Meanwhile, Taiwan and China early this year passed a law to introduce a
        carbon tax on heavy emitters.</p><h2>#3. Record high carbon revenues
        almost at $100 billion </h2><p>This is perhaps the highlight of the
        report. Total carbon revenues from ETSs and taxes jump by over
        <strong>10%</strong> in 2022, hitting about <strong>$95
        billion</strong>. Compared to last year, the increase is worth
        <strong>$10 billion</strong>. </p><p>Carbon revenues are the product of
        the carbon price, specific emissions covered, and other pricing design
        factors like rebates and allocation methods. </p><p>Revenue in the EU
        ETS alone has grown<strong> 7x</strong> from 2017 amounts, generating a
        total of <strong>$42 billion</strong> in 2022. The <strong>$7.8
        billion</strong> increase accounts for over <strong>76%</strong> of the
        total increase in global carbon pricing revenues. This is partly because
        of higher prices, but also due to the shift from free carbon allowance
        allocation to auctioning.</p><p>In 2022, ETSs represented about<strong>
        69%</strong> of government income from direct carbon prices, while
        carbon taxes took the remaining <strong>31%</strong>.</p><p>As to where
        the governments spend the carbon revenues, the following figure shows
        the percent share of different uses.  </p><h2>#4. Carbon credit markets
        slowed, and demand is mostly voluntary </h2><p>After 2 years of steep
        growth, carbon credit markets slowed last year, with a
        +<strong>1%</strong> drop in retirements from 2021. A total of
        <strong>196 million</strong> carbon credits were retired in
        2022. </p><ul><li><div>The supply of new carbon credits and demand from
        end users decreased a little bit, reversing the previous year’s
        increase.</div></li></ul><p>As seen below, independent crediting
        mechanisms or <a
        title="https://carboncredits.com/voluntary-carbon-market-can-be-worth-1-trillion-in-2037/"
        href="https://carboncredits.com/voluntary-carbon-market-can-be-worth-1-trillion-in-2037/">voluntary
        carbon markets</a> supply most of the credits. But credit issuances from
        international mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) grew
        in 2022, representing <strong>30%</strong> of total
        issuance. </p><p>Voluntary corporate use of carbon credits remains to be
        the major source of demand in the market. </p><p>Also, more and more
        nations are thinking about establishing their own carbon credit
        mechanisms. This plan is often in conjunction with an ETS or carbon tax
        policy. </p><p>For example, both Indonesia and Vietnam made some
        preparations to establish domestic carbon credit schemes while South
        Africa assessed their internal standards to produce credits.</p><h2>#5.
        Nature-Based carbon credits may overtake Renewable
        Energy</h2><p>Renewable energy still dominates carbon markets. The share
        of carbon credits generated by renewable energy activities has been
        rising since 2018. They represent about 45% of registered projects and
        account for 55% of credit issuances in 2022. </p><p>In terms of carbon
        credits retired last year, 52% came from renewable energy projects, up
        from 44% in 2021. <a title="go to glossary definition of RECs"
        href="/glossary#renewable-energy-credits-recs">Renewable energy credits
        (RECs)</a> are still widely available and among the cheapest credit
        types.</p><p>But as the cost of renewable energy fell significantly over
        the last 10 years, RE projects may no longer need the extra revenues
        from carbon credits. This signals that the value of RECs will eventually
        go down.  </p><p>Thus, the supply of carbon credits from large RE
        projects will most likely decline over time. Some voluntary carbon
        crediting schemes have restricted eligibility, particularly for projects
        in the least developed nations. </p><p>Meanwhile, there has been a
        growing focus on nature-based activities. These include projects
        involving emissions reductions from agriculture and forestry and land
        use. The credits they produce often deliver co-benefits – other
        socio-economic benefits aside from carbon reduction – valued by many
        buyers.</p><p>Though credit issuances from forestry and land use
        activities drop in 2022, this may change soon, according to industry
        experts. Last year, <strong>54%</strong> of new projects registered were
        for nature-based solutions, indicating a potential for supply expansion
        in the future.  </p><h2>#6. Exchange-traded credits from removal
        projects trade at a premium </h2><p>Carbon credit prices and trends vary
        across market segments and project types. Nature-based credits saw the
        highest price drop, from as much as $16 to below $5.</p><p>The rising
        use of standardized contracts is considered one factor of a downward
